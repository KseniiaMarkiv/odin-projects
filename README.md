## What Projects Are Here

This repository contains Ruby on Rails projects completed as part of [The Odin Projects](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Each project builds upon fundamental Rails concepts, from basic CRUD operations to user authentication and deployment:

1. **Blog-app**: A blogging platform where users can create, edit, and manage posts. This project focuses on understanding the Rails MVC architecture, setting up routes, and using ActiveRecord to manage database interactions. [Project details](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-blog-app)

2. **Micro-reddit**: A simplified version of Reddit where users can create posts and comments. It emphasizes database relationships and associations (one-to-many, many-to-many), input validation, and how to model complex data structures using ActiveRecord.

3. **Re-former**: A project designed to practice creating and handling forms in Rails. This includes using form helpers, handling validations, and learning how to process user input securely through strong parameters. [Project details](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-forms)

4. **Members-only**: A community site where only signed-in members can create, edit, and manage posts. This project focuses on user authentication with sessions, implementing authorization rules, and managing user roles, covering more advanced topics like secure password management.
